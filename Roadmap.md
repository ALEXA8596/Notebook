Inspired by Obsidian, Notion, Excalidraw, OneNote, GoodNotes, etc.

 - [ ] Freehand notetaking (wide ruled, college ruled, graph, none)
 - [ ] Excalidraw Fork
 - [ ] Filesystem (i.e. Obsidian, VSC)
 - [ ] Freehand Markdown hybrid (Stempad?)
 - [ ] [handwriting recognition](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/blob/master/src/shared/OCR/Taskbone.ts)

I plan to use this project to familiarize myself with git and github. I'll be using branches, pull requests, and releases.

Unsure when I'll actually start this project. I'll probably start before July 2026
